Python Backup
=============

There two programs here.  A scheduler which makes backups and the script which
actually makes the backups.  It is highly programmably which files,
directories are choosen for backups.  Backups can be send on a server via scp
(a secure connection).  They also can be compressed (tar.gz, tar.bz, 7z) and
encryped (with gpg).
